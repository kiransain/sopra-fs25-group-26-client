# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Implemented their corresponding JPA repositories to enable database operations for each entity.            | Defined the core entities (Game, Player, User) and their repositories, forming the foundation for all game and user interactions in the backend. |

| **@ermin-mumic**   | 31.03.2025       | [Login logic](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/c5d4b4befab3761829fe582786e915fcecb48a21 )                | Added endpoint to validate user credentials and return the stored token upon successful login.                                                                                 | Enables secure user login and token-based authentication, which is required to protect routes and link actions to specific users. |
| **@ermin-mumic**   | 31.03.2025       | [Game creation logic](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/405fb3652cdc319129e3e7baf2172246b42bc092 )        | Implemented logic to create a game and automatically register the creator as a player with location and role while handling error cases.                                       | Allows users to create games and participate as players, enabling the core gameplay flow of ManHunt. |
| **@kiransain**     | 28.03.2025       | [Maps Integration](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/addd68fdf76c7d0c3f622eb009c10a9eed06552c) - [Live Location]( https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/0ee9296b8c6bd5e2d626e8061040abaed90b4fb0) - [Map Zoom/Move](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/910920e9f31fda609584810011a0576e3b5c0cda) | Google Maps API is integrated into the front end to be accessible from Vercel and localhost. The live location of a user is displayed on the map. The map is movable and can be zoomed in. This worked after I fixed API-key issues (like pasting the wrong key) and commenting out front-end elements like the attempt to create a circle.                                                                                   | This is very relevant because our game is literally based on a map, so it is very crucial that the API works. It is important that the key works on both deployment and locally so that all of us can test and see what we coded locally and on Vercel because before that, only Vercel or localhost worked, but not both. I implemented the foundational steps of our project. |
| **@kiransain**     | 27.03.2025       | [API Key storage](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/302846df3197b021c8cab878a3d6a08cb05e165e ) - [Dedicated Map Class](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/e92c946c4abce8c516ca906b1fc3fb5e894b5411)           | The API key is securely stored and not visible on the front end.                                                                                                               | This is very important due to security issues - the API key should not be exposed and should be kept safely on the backend. This task was very time-consuming, as I faced on deployment and locally issues, on top on GitHub. |
