# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Implemented their corresponding JPA repositories to enable database operations for each entity.             | Defined the core entities (Game, Player, User) and their repositories, forming the foundation for all game and user interactions in the backend. |

| @kiransain | 28.03.2025 | https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/addd68fdf76c7d0c3f622eb009c10a9eed06552c| Google Maps API is integrated into the front end to be accessible from Vercel and localhost. | Relevant so that all of us can test and see what we coded locally as well as on Vercel because before, only Vercel or localhost worked but not both. So important for work. |
| @kiransain | 27.03.2025   | https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/302846df3197b021c8cab878a3d6a08cb05e165e | The API key is securely stored and not visible on the front end.| This is very important due to security issues - the API key should not be exposed and kept safely on the backend. |
