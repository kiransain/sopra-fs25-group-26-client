# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

Implemented their corresponding JPA repositories to enable database operations for each entity.            | Defined the core entities (Game, Player, User) and their repositories, forming the foundation for all game and user interactions in the backend. |
| **@ermin-mumic**   | 29.03.2025       | [Registration logic](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/1235911949d6885c0cf7747ab63e05776520c533)          | Implemented user registration logic, including saving new users to the database with a generated token and initial stats as well as handling error for already taken usernames. | Enables user account creation and authentication, which is essential for tracking players and managing game participation. |
| **@ermin-mumic**   | 31.03.2025       | [Login logic](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/c5d4b4befab3761829fe582786e915fcecb48a21 )                | Added endpoint to validate user credentials and return the stored token upon successful login.                                                                                 | Enables secure user login and token-based authentication, which is required to protect routes and link actions to specific users. |
| **@ermin-mumic**   | 31.03.2025       | [Game creation logic](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/405fb3652cdc319129e3e7baf2172246b42bc092 )        | Implemented logic to create a game and automatically register the creator as a player with location and role while handling error cases.                                       | Allows users to create games and participate as players, enabling the core gameplay flow of ManHunt. |
| **@kiransain**     | 28.03.2025       | [Google Maps API Integration](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/addd68fdf76c7d0c3f622eb009c10a9eed06552c) | Google Maps API is integrated into the front end to be accessible from Vercel and localhost.                                                                                   | Relevant so that all of us can test and see what we coded locally as well as on Vercel because before, only Vercel or localhost worked but not both. So important for work. |
| **@kiransain**     | 27.03.2025       | [API Key storage](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-client/commit/302846df3197b021c8cab878a3d6a08cb05e165e )            | The API key is securely stored and not visible on the front end.                                                                                                               | This is very important due to security issues - the API key should not be exposed and kept safely on the backend. |

| **@ermin-mumic** | [06.04.2025 | [REST Mapping to get joinable games](https://github.com/kiransain/sopra-fs25-group-26-server/commit/3854b9291a71f5e08efdf24007fbd6e20e27a953)                                 | Created a REST endpoint that retrieves only joinable games from the backend. This mapping filters games by their status, ensuring that clients receive a list of active, available games for players to join.                                                                           | It ensures that players see only games they can join, improving user experience and system efficiency.                                                                                                                                                    |

This logic checks if the game is joinable (in lobby and with fewer than 5 players) and if the user isnâ€™t already a player, then adds them as a new player, or updates their location if they are already in the game. | This feature is key for managing game participation. It ensures that only valid joinable games are accessible and enforces player count limits.                                                                                                           |

Aswell as a REST endpoint to retrieve all players in a game.                                            | The polling mechanism ensures real-time location updates for each player, while allowing only the creator to start the game.
