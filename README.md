# üïµÔ∏è Welcome to **Manhunt!**

## üéØ Introduction

**Manhunt** is a mobile, multiplayer web application that reimagines classic hide-and-seek for the smartphone era. By blending real-world movement with battle‚Äêroyale‚Äìstyle dynamics, it brings back a nostalgic childhood game in a modern, enhanced form‚Äîmaking playing outside fun again.

Players join or create a game as either **<span style="color:#722ed1">Hunter</span>** or **<span style="color:#fadb14">Hider</span>**, then physically move within a geo-fenced play area that dynamically shrinks. Strategic power-ups‚Äî**Reveal** (briefly expose all players) and **Recenter** (shift the game center)‚Äîadd tactical depth. All clients remain tightly synchronized‚Äîsharing GPS positions, player statuses, and a server-anchored countdown‚Äîto ensure fairness and eliminate boundary or timing disputes.

**Motivation**
- Rekindle the joy of a nostalgic outdoor game with modern technology  
- Solve childhood hide-and-seek frustrations (lost players, boundary disputes, unfair starts)  
- Encourage physical activity, social interaction and strategic thinking  
- Offer quick, repeatable rounds with clear rules and engaging mechanics

## üß© High-Level Components

1. **Pages**
   - **Role:** Serve as the main entry points for each URL route, defining layout and page logic.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Import and render UI **Components** for page-specific views.  
     - Use **Hooks** to obtain data and manage states.  
     - Call **API Service** methods to retrieve and update backend data.
   - **Main File:**
   [games/[gameId]/[playerId]/page](app/games/%5BgameId%5D/%5BplayerId%5D/page.tsx)

2. **Components**
    - **Role:** Encapsulate shared UI elements for map integration, including the provider and the map renderer.
    - **Correlations:**
        - Imported by **Pages** to display the game map.
        - **GoogleMapsProvider** uses a 'useEffect' hook to fetch and initialize the Google Maps API key on mount.
        - **MapComponent** consumes the provider's context to render the map, player markers and game area circle.
        - Styles are applied via CSS modules in the **Styles**.
   - **Main File:**
   [GoogleMapsProvider](app/components/GoogleMapsProvider.tsx)

3. **API Service**
   - **Role:** Centralize all HTTP communication with the backend REST API.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Invoked by **Pages** and **Hooks** to fetch or mutate game and user data.  
     - Returns JSON payloads that are passed into **Components** for rendering.
   - **Main File:**
   [apiService](app/api/apiService.ts)

4. **Hooks**
   - **Role:** Provide shared logic (e.g., geolocation, audio playback, polling) as reusable React hooks.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Employed in **Pages** and **Components** to abstract side effects and stateful logic.  
     - Rely on **API Service** to fetch data where needed.
   - **Main File:**
   [useGoogleMaps](app/hooks/useGoogleMaps.ts)

5. **Styles**
   - **Role:** Define the visual theming and layout using scoped CSS Modules.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Imported by **Pages** and **Components** to ensure consistent styling across the app.
   - **Main File:**
   [game-play](app/styles/game-play.css)

### Main User Flows:
1.**Login/Register Page** - The main entry point, where users login or register to access the app.

2.**Overview Page** ‚Äì The hub, where users can see all active game lobbies, join them or create a new one. Additionally, users can view their profile and global rankings by clicking on the profile icon in the top right corner or read about the rules in the information section.

3.**Create Game** ‚Äì The creator sets the game parameters. After successfully creating a game, the user is redirected to the game lobby.

4.**Game Lobby** ‚Äì All players gather here before the game starts. The creator can start the game, and all players can leave the lobby.

5.**Main Game in Preparation** ‚Äì The game is in preparation mode. Players can see their updated realtime location on the map, their roles and the game area. The main game starts when the countdown reaches zero.

6.**Main Game in Progress** ‚Äì The game is in progress. Players can additionally see their role-specific power ups. Hiders also have a 'caught' button to admit they are caught. Players outside of the game area have 10 seconds to return into the game area otherwise they are out. The game ends when the countdown reaches zero, all hiders were caught or the hunter it out due the out-of-area penalty.

8.**Profile Page** ‚Äì The profile page shows the player's statistics, including the number of games played, won and lost and their points. From here users can access the global leaderboard, update their password or log out.
