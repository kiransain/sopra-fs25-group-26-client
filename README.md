# üïµÔ∏è Welcome to **Manhunt!**

## üéØ Introduction

**Manhunt** is a mobile, multiplayer web application that reimagines classic hide-and-seek for the smartphone era. By blending real-world movement with battle‚Äêroyale‚Äìstyle dynamics, it brings back a nostalgic childhood game in a modern, enhanced form‚Äîmaking playing outside fun again.

Players join or create a game as either **<span style="color:#722ed1">Hunter</span>** or **<span style="color:#fadb14">Hider</span>**, then physically move within a geo-fenced play area that dynamically shrinks. Strategic power-ups‚Äî**Reveal** (briefly expose all players) and **Recenter** (shift the game center)‚Äîadd tactical depth. All clients remain tightly synchronized‚Äîsharing GPS positions, player statuses, and a server-anchored countdown‚Äîto ensure fairness and eliminate boundary or timing disputes.

**Motivation**
- Rekindle the joy of a nostalgic outdoor game with modern technology  
- Solve childhood hide-and-seek frustrations (lost players, boundary disputes, unfair starts)  
- Encourage physical activity, social interaction and strategic thinking  
- Offer quick, repeatable rounds with clear rules and engaging mechanics

## üß© High-Level Components

1. **Pages**
   - **Role:** Serve as the main entry points for each URL route, defining layout and page logic.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Import and render UI **Components** for page-specific views.  
     - Use **Hooks** to obtain data and manage states.  
     - Call **API Service** methods to retrieve and update backend data.
   - **Main File:**
   [games/[gameId]/[playerId]/page](app/games/%5BgameId%5D/%5BplayerId%5D/page.tsx)

2. **Components**
    - **Role:** Encapsulate shared UI elements for map integration, including the provider and the map renderer.
    - **Correlations:**
        - Imported by **Pages** to display the game map.
        - **GoogleMapsProvider** uses a 'useEffect' hook to fetch and initialize the Google Maps API key on mount.
        - **MapComponent** consumes the provider's context to render the map, player markers and game area circle.
        - Styles are applied via CSS modules in the **Styles**.
   - **Main File:**
   [GoogleMapsProvider](app/components/GoogleMapsProvider.tsx)

3. **API Service**
   - **Role:** Centralize all HTTP communication with the backend REST API.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Invoked by **Pages** and **Hooks** to fetch or mutate game and user data.  
     - Returns JSON payloads that are passed into **Components** for rendering.
   - **Main File:**
   [apiService](app/api/apiService.ts)

4. **Hooks**
   - **Role:** Provide shared logic (e.g., geolocation, audio playback, polling) as reusable React hooks.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Employed in **Pages** and **Components** to abstract side effects and stateful logic.  
     - Rely on **API Service** to fetch data where needed.
   - **Main File:**
   [useGoogleMaps](app/hooks/useGoogleMaps.ts)

5. **Styles**
   - **Role:** Define the visual theming and layout using scoped CSS Modules.
   - **Correlations:**  
     - Imported by **Pages** and **Components** to ensure consistent styling across the app.
   - **Main File:**
   [game-play](app/styles/game-play.css)
